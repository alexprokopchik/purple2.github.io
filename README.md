THIS IS AN ASSIGNMENT FOR OUR COMPUTATIONAL WORLDS CLASS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON TACOMA.  THE CLASS IS TAUGHT BY DR. CHRIS MARRIOT.  THE REQUIREMENT IS THAT IT BE A LAUNCHABLE WEB APP WRITTEN IN JAVASCRIPT.

FOR OUR PROJECT WE CHOSE TO BUILD A 2D FIGHTER.  AT FIRST WE WERE THINKING STREET FIGHTER-ISH CHARACTERS AGAINST REAL LIFE PHOTOS FOR SOMETHING A LITTLE DIFFERENT.  THEN WE HAD THE GREAT IDEA OF CREATING SPRITE SHEETS OF OURSELVES AND THE RESULT, AT LEAST SO FAR, IS AVAILABLE TO TEST @ "http://purple2.github.io/". (2/7/2015)

WE HAVE TRIED TO SPLIT THE CODE UP A BIT FOR READABILITY AND IN PREPARATION OF A FIGHTER INTERFACE FOR THE DIFFERENT CHARACTERS.
